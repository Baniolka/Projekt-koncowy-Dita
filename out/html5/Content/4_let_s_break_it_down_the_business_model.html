        <p class="p">Business model? Business plan? It's easy to get them mixed up because they sound alike.
            But in practice, they serve different purposes.</p>
        <p class="p">A business model is like a high-level blueprint for your company. It outlines the core
            idea - what you're offering, who your customers are, and how you'll make money. Think of
            it as the basic recipe for your business success.</p>
        <p class="p">On the other hand, a business plan dives deeper. It details the steps needed to turn your
            business model into reality. This includes things like marketing strategies, financial
            projections (showing how much money you expect to make and spend), and operational plans
            (how you'll get everything done). It's like taking your recipe and figuring out the
            exact measurements, cooking times, and temperatures to create a delicious dish.</p>
        <p class="p">In short, the business model is the "what" and "why" of your business, while the business
            plan is the detailed "how" to make it happen.</p>
