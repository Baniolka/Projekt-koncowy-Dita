        <div class="p">As I mentioned earlier, startups are high-risk ventures. There can be many obstacles that
            lead to failure. It's crucial to consider potential weaknesses - even at the idea stage.
            According to "The Top 20 Reasons Startups Fail" report, the five most common reasons
                are:<figure class="fig fignone" id="_1_5_why_did_the_idea_fail_reasons_why_a_startup_fails__fig_hvs_jmb_qbc"><figcaption><span class="fig--title-label">Figure 1. </span>The most common reasons why startups fail.</figcaption>

                    viable solution or just a catchy slogan? The assumptions and benefits might not
                    interest your target audience or be practical for everyday use. When building a
                    business model, make sure your product solves a real problem and is scalable.
                    Remember, there's no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>

            <li class="li">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Financial Exhaustion:</strong> Startups allow you to test an idea with low initial
                    costs, but what happens next? If you poorly define the market need and business
                    model, you might find that making changes is both time-consuming and expensive.
                    Even external funding might not be enough if you need to rebuild from
                    scratch.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Lack of the Right Team:</strong> You have the idea and the funding, but you don’t
                    have the people to bring it to life. Without a strong in-house team or a
                    reliable external partner, your product might never reach the market, and you
                    risk burning out.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Better Competition: </strong>Having competition is good - it pushes you to improve.
                    You need to create a unique product that’s hard to copy. If you don’t react
                    quickly to changes and customer feedback, you might lose out. Customers will
                    choose a simpler, higher-quality, more effective, or cheaper solution.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
                <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Price/Cost Issues:</strong> The market is dynamic, and solutions developed 3-4
                    years ago might be obsolete now. If your product's price doesn’t match its
                    quality, customers will move on. Producing cheaply and pleasing investors
                    doesn't always work. A flawed business model, high costs for changes or
                    improvements, ignoring advisors, releasing products too early or too late, legal
                    issues - many factors (often several at once) can make further investment in a
                    startup unprofitable.</p>
