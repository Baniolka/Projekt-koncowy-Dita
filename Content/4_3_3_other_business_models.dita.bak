    <title>4.3.3 Other business models</title>
    <shortdesc>Short about Lean Canvas.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>The canvas model isn't the only game in town. There's also the <b>Lean Canvas,</b> which
            focuses on the most critical aspects of your business and zeroes in on generating
            revenue and turning a profit.</p>
        <p>Remember, a well-crafted business model can be the bedrock of your future business. But
            it's not set in stone. Keep revisiting and improving it as your startup (or maybe a
            fully-fledged company at that point) grows and evolves. That way, you'll always stay
            ahead of the curve.</p>
