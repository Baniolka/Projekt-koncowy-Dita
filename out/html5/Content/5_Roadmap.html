        <p class="p">You’ve got the vision outlined, the strategy is in place, and there’s probably a business
            model and a typical business plan on file. Now, it’s time to dive into the details.</p>
        <p class="p">A roadmap is a document, often presented as a graphical diagram, that outlines the vision
            for the emerging product, the work plan, performance metrics, and other critical
            information. This helps the team see where they are and whether they’re making progress.
            The roadmap should be clear and understandable for everyone. Each team member has
            specific tasks aimed at achieving a common goal, and the roadmap helps visualize this.
            You might even create different roadmaps for different teams or departments, but they
            should all aim for the same goals.</p>
        <p class="p">Startups often struggle to stay focused due to the vast amount of work and limited time
            and resources. A product roadmap provides a clear direction and helps your team align on
            key priorities.</p>
        <p class="p"></p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">When do you need a roadmap?</strong> Usually, when you want or need a broader view of
            the product’s future or to check assumptions about the target audience, needs, or key
            business aspects. If you’re uncertain about the future of your product development,
            don’t bother with a roadmap.</p>
        <div class="p">Every product is unique, so there’s no one-size-fits-all template for a roadmap. However,
            consider including the following areas:<ul class="ul" id="roadmap__ul_vrh_y4y_pbc">
