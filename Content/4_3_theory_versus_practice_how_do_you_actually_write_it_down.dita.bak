                <p>First off, be honest with yourself. Answer the questions we discussed earlier in
                    the four key areas.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>After that, it's all about picking the right tools to gather the data you
                    need.</p><b>Remember! </b>Make sure to choose a tool that grows with your
                business and allows you to use that data down the road.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Once you've got your data, it's time to put pen to paper (or fingers to
                    keyboard). Write down everything you already know, and even what you assume you
                    know, into a model.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now, when it comes to writing down your business model, there are plenty of ways to do
            it. One of the most popular methods is the canvas model, which is presented in the form
            of a table.</p>
