    <title>4.2 Alright, let's break it down... the phases of business model development</title>
    <shortdesc>4 phases of business model development.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Four phases can be distinguished in the work on the business model.</p>
        </context>
        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>First up, there’s the <b>initiation phase</b>. This is where you analyze the
                    current state of things. You're looking at potential revenue, market gaps, and
                    all the external factors. </cmd>
                <substeps>
                    <substep>
                        <cmd>Dive into the micro-environment - think about consumers, partners, and
                            competition.</cmd>
                    </substep>
                    <substep>
                        <cmd>Then zoom out to the macro-environment - consider tech trends,
                            megatrends, and regulations</cmd>
                    </substep>
                </substeps>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Next, move into the <b>ideation phase</b>. That's where you need to get your
                    creative juices flowing. You’ll be brainstorming ideas for a new business model
                    within your project team(s). You can approach this in a couple of ways:</cmd>
                <substeps>
                    <substep>
                        <cmd>scout similar industries and tweak ideas to fit yours,</cmd>
                    </substep>
                    <substep>
                        <cmd>mix and match different successful models to create your own.</cmd>
                    </substep>
                </substeps>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>After all the analyzing, it's time to build. The <b>integration phase</b> is
                    about refining that concept you've cooked up. Focus on four key areas: </cmd>
                <info>
                    <ul id="ul_dhf_p2y_pbc">
                        <li>Customers - what do they want and how do they want it?</li>
                        <li>Value proposition - what problem are you solving and why are you better
                            than the rest?</li>
                        <li>Resources and processes - what's it going to take to make this
                            happen?</li>
                        <li>evenue generation - how are you going to make the cash flow?</li>
                    </ul>
                </info>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Finally, we've got the <b>implementation phase</b>. This is where you take your
                    prototype and throw it into the market. Get feedback from everyone and anyone -
                    customers, suppliers, partners, you name it. This feedback is gold - it'll help
                    you tweak your model and make it market-ready. And that's how you turn an idea
                    into a viable business model. Easy, right?</cmd>
