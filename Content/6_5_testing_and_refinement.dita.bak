        <p>During this phase, you release the prototype "into the wild" to ensure it meets the
            expectations of the target audience. </p>
        <p>Here's what you need to do:</p>
        <ul id="ul_bpx_nvy_pbc">
            <li>
                <p>Launch a sample batch of products (<xref href="8_glossary.dita#mmp"
                    >MMP</xref>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Conduct marketing tests to gather feedback from initial users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Refine the product based on the results of user acceptance tests (<xref
                        href="8_glossary.dita#uat">UAT</xref>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Release the revised product (next iteration).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Finalize the design and prepare the final technical and engineering
                    documentation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Finalize the marketing plan, including setting the price, promotional strategy,
                    and preparing the marketing campaign.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once these steps are completed, you seamlessly transition from prototype to final
            product, ready for scaling and further iterations.</p>
