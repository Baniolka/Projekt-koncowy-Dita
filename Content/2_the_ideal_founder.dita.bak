            <li><b>Team-Building Skills</b>
                <p>Success starts with the right team. Find people who can help develop the startup
                    and the product, and ensure they work well together.</p>
                <u>As a <xref href="8_glossary.dita#founder">founder</xref>, it's great if:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a knack for understanding people and selecting the right ones.</li>
                    <li>You can make tough decisions about your team.</li>
                    <li>You are impartial but demanding.</li>
                    <li>Empathy also comes in handy.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Communication and Management Skills</b>
                <p>Picking the right people is just the beginning. You also will need to manage and
                    communicate effectively with them.</p>
                <u>As a <xref href="8_glossary.dita#founder">founder</xref>, it's great if:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can communicate clearly?</li>
                    <li>You know how to delegate tasks.</li>
                    <li>You can communicate well with employees, business partners, investors,
                        etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Financial Skills</b>
                <p>The biggest danger for a startup is losing liquidity. Good financial management
                    and accounting skills are crucial, and the ability to raise external funding is
                    vital.</p>
                <u>As a <xref href="8_glossary.dita#founder">founder</xref>, it's great if:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>You know how to manage liquidity.</li>
                    <li>You understand pricing, cash flow, revenue modeling, profits, costs,
                        etc.</li>
                    <li>You can eventually hand over these responsibilities to a hired
                        specialist.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Sales Skills</b>
                <p>One of the key skills for a startup is effective salesmanship. It's not just
                    about pushing your product but understanding customer needs and building
                    relationships.</p>
                <u>As a <xref href="8_glossary.dita#founder">founder</xref>, it's great if:</u>
                <ul>
                    <li>You understand potential customers' needs.</li>
                    <li>You can establish strong relationships with them.</li>
                    <li>You know how to generate interest in your product.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Technical Skills</b>
                <p>Especially important if you're creating a tech startup. You wonâ€™t be able to
                    delegate all technical aspects to an outside company; this knowledge is crucial
                    for the project's success and team motivation.</p>
