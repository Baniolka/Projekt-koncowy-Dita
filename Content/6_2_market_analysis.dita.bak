        <p>This phase helps you pinpoint your target market, understand its size, and identify
            growth opportunities. By uncovering the latest trends and customer desires, you'll
            realize we focus more on fulfilling a need rather than creating a specific product.
            Here's what you need to do:</p>
        <ul id="ul_ydh_t5y_pbc">
            <li>
                <p>Check legislation, legal restrictions, and possible patents. Read up on EU
                    directives and harmonized standards.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Research the competition. You can do this through <xref
                        href="8_glossary.dita#desk_research">desk research</xref>, talking to
                    experts, or hiring an external company to study the market and competitors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Conduct benchmarking by analyzing competitors' moves, actions, and
                    advantages.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gather initial feedback. Regular customer feedback helps improve the product.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a targeted product strategy based on the data collected.</p>
            </li>
