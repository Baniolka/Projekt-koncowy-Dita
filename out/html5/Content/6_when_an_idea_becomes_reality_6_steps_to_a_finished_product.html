        <p class="p">Great job! You've already picked up some key terms about starting a business and
            launching a startup. Some of these terms might have even come up more than once. Now,
            let's dive into the product itself and, more importantly, the stages of its creation.
            Creating a new product can seem complicated, but when you break it down into steps, it
            becomes much more manageable and makes sense.</p>
        <p class="p">It's crucial to understand that product development is not the same as product
            management!</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Product management</strong> covers every stage of the product lifecycle, dealing with all
            aspects of managing the product. This includes creating the product strategy and
            roadmap, development and launch, marketing and sales, user retention, and more.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Product development</strong> has a more focused scope. It involves the entire journey of
            the product, from idea and strategy to planning, building, and launching. It primarily
            centers on developing and constructing the product itself, but can also include related
            tasks like strategy and action planning.</p>
        <p class="p"> </p>
        <p class="p">The process of creating a new product, although unique each time, can be boiled down to
            six main steps. Following these steps helps break down tasks into manageable parts and
            facilitates team collaboration. Here's the breakdown:</p>
