    <title>From the big picture to the details</title>
    <body>
        <p>Success in a startup isn't just about having a great idea, luck, or hard work. You also
            need to break things down from the big picture to the details, step by step. You need to
            look ahead while thinking about the present. A vision, strategy, roadmap, and product
            backlog will help you with this.</p>

                <p><b>Vision:</b> This is the core reason why you want to create a product. It
                    answers the question of why you're doing this and whether you truly believe in
                    it. Your vision should have four key factors:</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Big (reach a wide audience and remain relevant even when strategy
                            changes),</p>

                <p><b>Strategy:</b> A high-level plan that helps to realize the vision and achieve
                    the goal. It defines how the vision will be brought to life. In the strategy, we
                    develop a <xref href="4_let_s_break_it_down_the_business_model.dita">business
                        model</xref>, business model canvas, <xref

                        maps</xref>. The strategy helps to answer key questions and establish a plan
                    of action. Remember, the strategy is not the final product plan!</p>
