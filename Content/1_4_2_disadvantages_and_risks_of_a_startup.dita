                <li>
                    <p><b>High Risk:</b> With innovative ideas, there’s no blueprint to follow.
                        Learning from mistakes is common, and the product might not meet customer
                        expectations. The risk of failure is substantial.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Funding Challenges: </b>Startups often survive as long as <xref
                            href="8_glossary.dita#founder">founders</xref> have personal funds or
                        loan money (<xref href="8_glossary.dita#bootstrapping"
                        >Bootstrapping</xref>). Finding external funding can be tough, especially
                        with high competition. Without early investor cooperation or stable funding,
                        even the best ideas can fail.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Limited Resources:</b> Startups usually begin with small budgets and
                        teams. This can hinder growth and operations, leading to internal conflicts.
                        Despite limited resources initially, it’s crucial to establish procedures
                        and responsibilities over time.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Lack of Defined Business Processes:</b> Poorly defined processes can lead
                        to bad customer service, financial losses, and even legal issues.
                        Outsourcing can help, but high costs are a barrier.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Incorrect Business Model Assumptions:</b> Over-optimism can doom a
                        company. Regularly test and update your business model to quickly address
                        flaws and shortcomings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><b>Ignoring Market Signals:</b> Stay vigilant. Launching a product is just
                        the beginning; maintaining and expanding it is another challenge. Monitor
                        customer behavior, competitors, and the broader economic and social
                        environment to react swiftly. Wishful thinking doesn’t work in business.</p>
