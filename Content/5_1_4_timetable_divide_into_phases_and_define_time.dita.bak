    <title>5.1.4 Timetable: Divide Into Phases and Define Time</title>
    <shortdesc>All about schedule in roadmap.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Now that you know what product you want to build, what you have, and what you need, you
            can break the work into manageable phases. The size of these phases may depend on your
            business experience or market knowledge. Initially, base stages on what you know,
            adjusting with feedback over time.</p>
        <p>Assign deadlines to each phase. Be specific but realistic. Consider dividing work into
            monthly stages, each with an assigned KPI. Your roadmap should include:</p>
        <ul id="ul_d5p_try_pbc">
            <li>
                <p>The order of feature and function implementation</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Estimated time for each stage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Resource allocation for each stage</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Milestones, defining major project phases</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A well-crafted timetable helps you and your teams manage time and resources effectively.
            It provides a clear view of project progress and improves internal communication.</p>
        <p>
            <note id="note_skt_vv2_qbc"> A roadmap isn't static. It will evolve throughout the
                project, so update it regularly.</note>
