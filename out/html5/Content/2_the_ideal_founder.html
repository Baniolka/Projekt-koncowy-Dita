                    vital.</p>

                <p class="p">One of the key skills for a startup is effective salesmanship. It's not just
                    about pushing your product but understanding customer needs and building
                    relationships.</p>

                    delegate all technical aspects to an outside company; this knowledge is crucial
                    for the project's success and team motivation.</p>
