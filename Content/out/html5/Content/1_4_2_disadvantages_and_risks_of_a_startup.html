                        Learning from mistakes is common, and the product might not meet customer
                        expectations. The risk of failure is substantial.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Funding Challenges: </strong>Startups often survive as long as <a class="xref" href="8_glossary.html#founder">founders</a> have personal funds or loan money. Finding
                        external funding can be tough, especially with high competition. Without
                        early investor cooperation or stable funding, even the best ideas can
                        fail.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Limited Resources:</strong> Startups usually begin with small budgets and
                        teams. This can hinder growth and operations, leading to internal conflicts.
                        Despite limited resources initially, it’s crucial to establish procedures
                        and responsibilities over time.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Lack of Defined Business Processes:</strong> Poorly defined processes can lead
                        to bad customer service, financial losses, and even legal issues.
                        Outsourcing can help, but high costs are a barrier.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Incorrect Business Model Assumptions:</strong> Over-optimism can doom a
                        company. Regularly test and update your business model to quickly address
                        flaws and shortcomings.</p>

                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Ignoring Market Signals:</strong> Stay vigilant. Launching a product is just
                        the beginning; maintaining and expanding it is another challenge. Monitor
                        customer behavior, competitors, and the broader economic and social
                        environment to react swiftly. Wishful thinking doesn’t work in business.</p>
