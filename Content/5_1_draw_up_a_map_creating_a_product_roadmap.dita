        <p>Your vision is constant, your strategy can change, and your roadmap needs to adapt and
            keep up with feedback. It's a 'living' document you should check regularly. There are
            many roadmap templates you can use for visualization: goal-oriented roadmaps, Jira
            boards, Gantt charts, or a simple timeline. Choose what works for you. Consider who
            youâ€™re sharing your roadmap with (internal teams, investors, or potential customers) and
            the level of detail you want to convey.</p>
